# sheenna.github.io 
Version 1.0

A simple, static personal website detailing content on my resume in a web-friendly way. 
~~(It concerns me that it's slightly reminiscent of Myspace...)~~

List of changes I'd like to make in the future: 

 - Adding modals for the project images that would provide more details, also, possibly an animated preview of the projects themselves.
 - Related to that, a dynamic view of projects from GitHub.
 - Also would like to add more pages/content
 - Small blog/blurb type feed
