			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>I'm a Computer Science college senior with too many interests and too little time.<br>
			Currently looking for an internship opportunity - I'd love to learn as much as I can!<br><br><small>
			I'm currently reading <s>(and scribbling outraged margin notes in!)</s><br> <i> Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed For Men</i><br>
			
			Some of my interests that come to mind are linguistics, visual and narrative media, poetry, database design, gardening, and the new daily math puzzle Digits by The New York Times<br>
			
			I am a firm believer that everyone has something they're just a little bit of an expert in, something they're excited about - I want to be the person hearing about it, making ideas come to life, and bringing people closer to their dreams.
